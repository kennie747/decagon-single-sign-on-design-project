# Single SignOn Design Project

## Project Description
Presented in this project is the design for a *Single Sign-On* (SSO) network for "Decagon".

The Decagon SSO network allows Decagon customers to add authentication and authorization functions to their applications with just a few clicks.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram, Block diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and Relational Model were employed in coming up with the design.

**An Example:**

Let's say you are building an e-commerce website that requires authentication and authorization; you can leverage Decagon SSO. You can configure your callback URL on the Decagon SSO dashboard and configure the login/registration methods and 2FA.

See the sample here https://www.okta.com

**Features**

For a start, the design offers the following features:

1. Customers can sign up on the SSO network to configure their applications.
2. Each customer application is entitled to a user management dashboard to see all its users.
3. The customer can configure the supported authentication method. We can support basic auth (username/email & password) and OAuth 2. This is the method their users would use to login/sign up when they click on sign up or login on their website.
4. The customer can create different customer groups per application and add permissions to each group.

**Project Output:**

This project has inferred as much information as needed to build the Decagon SSO network. It is just a piece of high-level information that allows you to expand on the ideas.
The project has:
1. Created a diagram of the different systems.
2. Provided a good UML/Database design to highlight the key components.
3. Highlighted my approach to OOP and how to design loosely-couped systems.
4. Created a deployment plan
5. Made the design based on a specific software architecture. 
6. Written about an approach to security
7. Showed how the system can scale
8. Shown how can we take advantage of concurrency and multi-core processors
9. Shown how I would set up an agile team to build this product
